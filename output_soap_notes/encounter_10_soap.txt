Subjective:
The patient reports playing golf in the last couple of days and not keeping track of dates anymore. The patient is aware of the presidential impeachment hearings related to Monica Lewinsky. The patient correctly identifies the current President as Clinton and recalls past Presidents, though initially confused Reagan and Bush.

Objective:
The patient was able to repeat three words: "Chevrolet, zebra, honesty," and recall them later. The patient identified three objects in the room: TV, stopwatch, and book, and recalled them later. The patient correctly identified the day of the week as Saturday and the city as Boston but was incorrect about the date, stating October 21st instead of November 21st. The patient correctly spelled "world" backwards as "D-L-R-O-W." The patient demonstrated the use of a comb and mimed blowing out a candle. The patient drew a clock face with the hands set to ten past eleven and wrote a simple sentence. The patient drew a cube and marked locations on a map of the U.S. The interviewer noted the patient's orientation to geography, memory, recall of past and current events, and language were intact.

Assessment:
The clinician observed that the patient demonstrated adequate orientation, memory, and recall abilities. There were no significant concerns noted during the mental status screening.
