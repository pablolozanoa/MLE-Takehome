Subjective:  
The patient reports difficulty keeping track of dates, stating, "I don’t really keep track of dates anymore." They correctly identified the day of the week as Saturday and the city as Boston but misidentified the date as October 21st instead of November 21st. The patient recalls the current president as Clinton and mentions the impeachment hearings related to Monica Lewinsky. They express some uncertainty with memory tasks but successfully repeat words and recall items from the room. The patient states, "Haven’t done this in a while," when asked to draw a clock and shows some hesitation in spelling "world" backwards. Overall, the patient seems to have some memory lapses but is engaged and cooperative during the assessment.

Objective:  
No detailed physical examination performed. The patient demonstrated the ability to repeat words, recall items, and perform tasks such as miming actions and drawing. They showed orientation to geography and were able to recall past and current events. The patient’s responses indicated some cognitive challenges, particularly with date recall and memory tasks, but overall functioning appeared adequate during the assessment.

Assessment:  
Cognitive assessment indicates some memory lapses, particularly with dates and current events. However, the patient demonstrates adequate verbal and visual memory recall, orientation, and language skills. No significant cognitive impairment noted at this time. 

Plan:  
1. Continue to monitor cognitive function and memory during future visits.
2. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that stimulate memory and cognitive function, such as puzzles or memory games.
3. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3-6 months to reassess cognitive status.
4. If memory issues worsen or new symptoms arise, consider referral to a neurologist for further evaluation.
