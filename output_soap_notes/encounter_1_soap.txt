Diagnosis: See Assessment details below.

Subjective:
The patient, a graduate student, reports experiencing headaches for about a week, which have worsened. The headaches are described as dull and throbbing, primarily located on one side of the head, and are exacerbated by stress related to thesis defense and work. The pain is rated as a 5 out of 10 and lasts for a couple of hours. The patient has been using Excedrin Migraine, which provides relief. There is no associated nausea, vomiting, or aura. The patient consumes one to two cups of coffee daily, drinks alcohol occasionally, and does not use tobacco or recreational drugs. Past medical history includes seasonal allergies and eczema, with current use of Benadryl for allergies. Family history includes a mother with hypothyroidism, a father with high cholesterol and blood pressure, and a grandmother who died of brain cancer, which concerns the patient.

Objective:
Physical examination was conducted by a medical student. Cardiovascular exam: Heart auscultated, sounds normal. Respiratory exam: Lungs auscultated, sounds normal. Neurological exam: Cranial nerves assessed; eyes followed finger, facial symmetry tested, shoulder shrug against resistance, all normal. Osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) was performed on the neck to relieve tension. The patient reported feeling looser and better post-OMT.

Assessment:
The clinician's impression is that the patient is experiencing tension headaches likely due to stress. The symptoms do not suggest a serious condition such as brain cancer, which was a concern for the patient.

Plan:
1. Continue using Excedrin Migraine as needed for headache relief.
2. Perform self-stretches at home to alleviate neck tension.
3. Consider further evaluation with a fundoscopic exam to rule out other causes of headache.
4. Follow up with the primary care physician if symptoms persist or worsen.
