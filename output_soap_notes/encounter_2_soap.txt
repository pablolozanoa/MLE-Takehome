Subjective:  
Miss Jones reports experiencing headaches that began approximately two to three weeks ago, occurring at least three times a week, with increased frequency in the evenings. She describes the headaches as located around the front of her head and temples, rating the pain as a 5 out of 10. She notes that stress, particularly related to her graduate studies and thesis work, seems to exacerbate the headaches. Excedrin provides relief. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, numbness, or weakness. Miss Jones has a history of asthma but has not used her inhaler in the past six months. She maintains a healthy diet, exercises regularly through hot yoga, and consumes caffeine daily without changes to her routine. There are no known drug allergies, and her family history is notable for her father having high blood pressure and her grandfather having lung cancer.

Objective:  
Physical examination findings were generally unremarkable. Vital signs were not documented. The patient exhibited tight muscles during the examination, which were addressed with osteopathic manipulative medicine techniques. Neurological examination showed no deficits, with equal sensation and strength in all extremities. No detailed physical examination performed.

Assessment:  
Possible tension headache, likely related to stress and muscle tension. No evidence of secondary causes for headaches based on the history and physical examination.

Plan:  
1. Continue using Excedrin for headache relief as needed.
2. Consider applying heat to the neck and shoulders to help relax tight muscles.
3. Follow up with the physician for further evaluation and management.
4. Monitor headache frequency and severity; return if symptoms worsen or do not improve with current management.
