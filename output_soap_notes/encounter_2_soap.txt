Subjective:
Miss Jones reports experiencing headaches for the past two to three weeks, occurring at least three times a week, primarily in the evenings. She describes the pain as a 5 out of 10, located around the front of her head and temples. Stress, particularly related to her graduate studies and thesis work, seems to exacerbate the headaches. She finds relief with Excedrin. Miss Jones denies any nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, numbness, tingling, weakness, fevers, or chills. She maintains a healthy diet, exercises with hot yoga, and consumes coffee daily without changes in routine. She is married and has been for three years. Her medical history includes asthma, for which she has an inhaler but has not used it in six months. She has no known food allergies but is allergic to sulfa drugs. Her family history includes a father with high blood pressure and a grandfather who had lung cancer. She denies any other medications besides Excedrin.

Objective:
The physical exam was conducted by a medical student. Cardiovascular and respiratory exams were performed, including heart auscultation and lung auscultation with deep breaths. A cranial nerve assessment was conducted, including inspection of eye movements, facial sensation, and muscle strength. Reflexes were checked, and muscle strength was assessed in the arms. No abnormalities were noted during the exam. Osteopathic manipulative medicine was performed to relieve muscle tension, which resulted in some improvement in muscle tightness.

Assessment:
The clinician's impression is that Miss Jones is experiencing stress-related tension headaches. The absence of alarming symptoms suggests a benign etiology.

Plan:
1. Continue using Excedrin for headache relief as needed.
2. Apply heat to the neck and shoulder area to relax muscles.
3. Consider stress management techniques to reduce headache frequency.
4. Follow up with the physician for further evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen.
