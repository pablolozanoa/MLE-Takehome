Diagnosis: See Assessment details below.

Subjective:
The patient reports waking up with a strange pain on the right side, specifically in the lower right rib cage area. The pain is described as a constant dull ache, rated between four and six on a pain scale of ten, increasing to nine with deep breaths or sudden movements. The patient has not experienced similar pain before. The pain is manageable when the patient finds a certain position and avoids deep breaths. No other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or weight changes are reported. The patient recalls a fall while jogging last week, landing on the left side, but did not experience significant pain at the time. The patient has no history of hypertension, diabetes, cancer, or thyroid problems and is generally healthy. The patient is allergic to morphine, causing throat swelling, with the last reaction occurring years ago during wisdom teeth removal. No regular medications, vitamins, or supplements are taken. Surgical history includes only wisdom teeth removal about ten years ago. Family history includes a father who died of a heart attack at 65 with hypertension and heart disease, and a mother who died of breast cancer at 60. The patient writes children's books, does not smoke, consumes alcohol socially (two to three drinks a month), and denies illicit drug use. The patient is married, sexually active, and monogamous.

Assessment:
The patient's symptoms suggest a musculoskeletal issue, possibly related to the recent fall, although the pain is on the opposite side. Differential diagnoses may include rib fracture, muscle strain, or pleuritic pain. Further evaluation through physical examination and potentially imaging tests is necessary to determine the cause of the pain.

Plan:
1. Conduct a physical examination focusing on the right lower rib cage area.
2. Consider ordering imaging tests, such as an X-ray or ultrasound, if physical examination findings warrant further investigation.
3. Advise the patient to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain and to use over-the-counter pain relief if needed.
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to review test results and reassess the patient's condition.
