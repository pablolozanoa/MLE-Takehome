Subjective:  
The patient reports waking up this morning with a "really strange pain" on the right side of their lower rib cage, which they describe as a constant dull ache rated between four and six on a pain scale of ten. The pain intensifies to a nine when taking deep breaths or moving suddenly. The patient has never experienced this type of pain before and states that it is manageable when remaining still and avoiding deep breaths. They deny any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or unusual weight gain. The patient mentions a fall while jogging last week, where they tripped and fell on their left side but did not experience immediate pain. They have no significant past medical history, are allergic to morphine (causing throat swelling), and take no regular medications. Family history includes a father who died of heart disease and a mother who had breast cancer. The patient does not smoke, consumes alcohol socially (2-3 drinks per month), and is married with regular sexual activity.

Objective:  
No detailed physical examination performed.

Assessment:  
Possible musculoskeletal pain or injury related to recent fall; differential diagnoses may include rib injury or costochondritis. Further evaluation needed to rule out other causes.

Plan:  
1. Perform a physical examination to assess the pain and any associated findings.  
2. Consider imaging tests (e.g., X-ray) based on physical exam results to evaluate for rib injury or other underlying issues.  
3. Advise the patient to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain and to find comfortable positions to manage discomfort.  
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss findings and further management based on examination and imaging results.  
5. Educate the patient on signs and symptoms that would warrant immediate medical attention.
