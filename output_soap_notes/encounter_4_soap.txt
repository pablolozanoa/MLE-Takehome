Diagnosis: See Assessment details below.

Subjective:
The patient reports experiencing persistent abdominal pain for the past few months. They initially consulted with Dr. Donovan, who ordered a scan for gallstones. The patient was surprised to receive a call for a follow-up scan without a clear explanation. The patient expresses concern and surprise upon learning about a suspicious finding on the pancreas, fearing it might be cancer. The patient is 47 years old and is visibly shocked by the potential diagnosis. They inquire about the nature of the pancreas and possible treatment options, including surgical removal if cancer is confirmed. The patient prefers to attend future appointments alone.

Objective:
The clinician, Dr. Weber, reviews the results of two scans: an initial ultrasound and a follow-up CT scan. The ultrasound indicated a suspicious area on the pancreas, prompting the more detailed CT scan. The CT scan confirmed the presence of an abnormality on the pancreas. The clinician explains the function of the pancreas and the implications of the findings, emphasizing the need for specialist consultation to determine the nature of the abnormality. The clinician provides the patient with printed information about pancreatic cancer for further reading.

Assessment:
The primary concern is a suspicious finding on the pancreas, which may indicate a type of cancer. Further evaluation by a specialist is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of action.

Plan:
1. Refer the patient to a specialist for further evaluation of the pancreatic abnormality.
2. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the patient to discuss the specialist's findings and potential treatment options.
3. Provide the patient with educational materials about pancreatic cancer to review before the next appointment.
4. Encourage the patient to return for a follow-up appointment the next day for further discussion and support.
