Subjective:
The patient, Mr. Samara, is very upset and distraught over the care his son, Ramesh, received. Ramesh, a four-year-old boy, had been experiencing a sore throat and flu-like symptoms. Mr. Samara was concerned about meningitis due to a public health alert at his son's school and requested antibiotics from Dr. Jones, who declined, stating it was a viral issue. Mr. Samara followed Dr. Jones's advice to administer ibuprofen, but Ramesh's condition worsened, leading to drowsiness and vomiting. Mr. Samara expressed frustration with the difficulty in reaching the clinic and the lack of follow-up from the duty doctor. Ramesh was eventually admitted to the hospital, where he received IV fluids and antibiotics. Mr. Samara is worried about his son's future and is considering filing a complaint against Dr. Jones.

Objective:
The clinician, Dr. Gim, acknowledges Mr. Samara's distress and confirms the details of Ramesh's initial visit with Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones performed a limited examination, including taking Ramesh's temperature and examining his throat. No further physical examination details are provided. Ramesh is currently hospitalized and stable, receiving treatment for meningitis.

Assessment:
The clinician recognizes the need to investigate the care provided to Ramesh and the communication issues experienced by Mr. Samara. The clinician reassures Mr. Samara that the practice will conduct a thorough review of the events and involve him in the process.

Plan:
1. Speak with Dr. Smith, the senior partner, to initiate a practice meeting and review the care provided to Ramesh.
2. Ensure the practice manager contacts Mr. Samara to acknowledge his complaint and explain the complaint process within three days.
3. Conduct a root cause analysis to identify any opportunities for improvement in the care provided.
4. Offer Mr. Samara the opportunity to speak with Dr. Jones for an apology if desired.
5. Provide Mr. Samara with information on how to escalate the complaint if he is not satisfied with the outcome.
