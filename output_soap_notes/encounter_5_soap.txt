Subjective:  
Mr. Samara reports that his son, Ramish, a 4-year-old, was admitted to the hospital with meningitis after initially being seen by Dr. Jones for a sore throat and flu-like symptoms. Mr. Samara expressed significant distress, stating, "I'm just distraught, I'm upset, I'm angry." He feels that Dr. Jones did not take his concerns seriously when he suggested that Ramish might have meningitis, and he is frustrated that Dr. Jones did not prescribe antibiotics, claiming it was a viral issue. Mr. Samara followed Dr. Jones's advice but noted that Ramish's condition worsened, leading to drowsiness and vomiting, necessitating an emergency visit where Ramish was admitted and treated with IV fluids and antibiotics. Mr. Samara is concerned about his son's future and is considering filing a complaint against Dr. Jones.
