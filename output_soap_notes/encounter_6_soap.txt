Diagnosis: See Assessment details below.

Subjective:
The patient, Tell Harding, reports no known heart problems and has not been informed of any by a doctor. He experiences occasional shortness of breath during exertion, such as running for a bus, but considers it normal. He has no shoulder problems and describes his shoulders as quite flexible. He has had his blood pressure measured before, typically during annual check-ups, and recalls it being within the normal range.

Objective:
A comprehensive cardiovascular examination was performed. The examiner inspected the patient's hands, face, neck, chest, and abdomen. Pulses were palpated at the wrists and below the collarbone, all of which were regular. Blood pressure was measured twice, both readings within the normal range. The examiner auscultated the heart and lungs, noting normal heart sounds and clear lung sounds. The abdomen was palpated and auscultated, with no abnormalities detected. The feet were examined for pulses, temperature, and appearance, all of which were normal.

Assessment:
The examination findings were normal. The examiner noted no abnormalities in heart sounds, lung sounds, or abdominal examination. The cardiovascular examination will be completed with an ECG, review of any chest x-rays, and blood work.

Plan:
1. Complete the cardiovascular examination with an ECG.
2. Review any available chest x-rays.
3. Review any blood work that has been taken.
4. Continue routine monitoring of blood pressure during annual check-ups.
