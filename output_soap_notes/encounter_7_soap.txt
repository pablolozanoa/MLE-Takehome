Subjective:
The patient reports feeling a little numbness in the area of a previous injury but states that sensation has returned to most areas. They mention having a history of a cut and a concussion, which may have contributed to some ongoing issues. The patient expresses concern about a slight lid lag on the left side of their face, which they attribute to the previous injury. They note that the appearance of their eye has been consistent over time and is not a significant concern for them. The patient denies any problems with hearing or wax buildup.

Objective:
A cranial nerve examination was performed. The patient was able to follow finger movements and demonstrated appropriate responses to sensory tests. There was equal sensation noted on both sides of the face, with slight numbness in the area of the previous injury. The patient exhibited normal strength and coordination in upper and lower extremities. The lid lag on the left side was observed, but no neurological issues were identified. The patientâ€™s eyes appeared normal aside from the noted cosmetic concern. No detailed physical examination performed beyond the cranial nerve assessment.

Assessment:
The primary assessment indicates that the patient has residual effects from a previous concussion and facial injury, specifically a cosmetic lid lag on the left side. No neurological deficits were identified, and the numbness reported appears to be minimal and localized. Overall, the patient is stable with no acute issues.

Plan:
1. Continue to monitor the cosmetic appearance of the left eyelid; no immediate intervention required.
2. Reassure the patient that the lid lag is likely due to soft tissue changes rather than a neurological issue.
3. Advise the patient to return for follow-up if there are any changes in symptoms or if they develop new concerns.
4. Consider referral to a specialist (e.g., ophthalmologist) if the cosmetic concern becomes bothersome to the patient.
