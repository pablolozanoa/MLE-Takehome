Diagnosis: See Assessment details below.

Subjective:
The patient reports a history of a previous injury with some residual numbness in the area, but notes that sensation has returned to normal. The patient mentions a past concussion and associated redness and partial closure of the eye. The patient is aware of a slight lid lag on the left side since the injury, which they believe is not noticeable to others. The patient does not report any hearing problems or wax buildup.

Objective:
A comprehensive cranial nerve examination was performed. The patient was instructed to perform various tasks to assess reflexes, strength, and coordination. The examination included:
- Visual tracking and peripheral vision assessment.
- Sensation testing on the forehead and face, with normal findings.
- Facial muscle strength tests, including eye closure, forehead wrinkling, and teeth showing.
- Tongue protrusion and jaw clenching.
- Hearing assessment with soft noises, with normal findings.
- Shoulder shrug and head turning tests.
- Arm and hand coordination and strength tests, including finger-to-nose and rapid alternating movements.
- Leg strength tests, including knee lifting and resistance.
- Ankle vibration sensation test, with normal findings.
- Observation of a slight lid lag on the left eye, attributed to soft tissue changes post-injury, not neurological in nature.

Assessment:
The primary impression is that the patient has residual cosmetic changes from a previous injury, specifically a slight lid lag on the left eye. This is not considered a neurological issue but rather a cosmetic one due to soft tissue changes. No other abnormalities were noted in the cranial nerve examination.

Plan:
1. Continue monitoring the cosmetic appearance of the left eye lid lag.
2. No further neurological testing is deemed necessary at this time.
3. Reassure the patient that the lid lag is minimal and not noticeable to others.
4. Follow up as needed if any new symptoms arise.
