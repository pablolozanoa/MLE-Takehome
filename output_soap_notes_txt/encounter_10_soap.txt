Subjective:
The patient reports playing golf in the last couple of days and not keeping track of dates anymore. The patient is aware of the presidential impeachment hearings related to Monica Lewinsky.

Objective:
The patient was able to repeat three words: "Chevrolet, zebra, honesty." The patient identified three items in the room: TV, stopwatch, and book. The patient correctly identified the day of the week as Saturday and the city as Boston but was incorrect about the date, stating October 21st instead of November 21st. The patient identified the current year as 1998 and the current President as Clinton, with some initial confusion about previous Presidents. The patient demonstrated the ability to spell "world" backwards, mimed combing hair, and blowing out a candle. The patient drew a clock face set to ten past eleven, repeated the phrase "No ifs, ands or buts," and recalled the three items and words previously mentioned. The patient wrote a simple sentence, drew a cube, and marked locations on a map of the U.S.

Assessment:
The clinician observed that the patient demonstrated orientation to geography, memory (both verbal and visual), recall of past and current events, and language. The clinician noted that there is nothing to worry about at this point, indicating normal cognitive function based on the screening.

Plan:
1. No further cognitive testing required at this time.
2. Continue monitoring for any changes in cognitive function.
3. Encourage engagement in activities that stimulate memory and cognition.
