Subjective:
The patient reports waking up with a strange pain on the right side, specifically in the lower right rib cage area. The pain is described as a constant dull ache, rated between four and six on a pain scale of ten, increasing to nine with deep breaths or sudden movements. The pain started this morning, and the patient has never experienced anything similar before. The patient notes that finding a certain position in bed and avoiding deep breaths makes the pain manageable. There are no additional symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or unusual weight gain. The patient recalls a fall while jogging last week, landing on the left side, but did not experience significant pain at the time. The patient has no significant past medical history, no regular medications, and is allergic to morphine, which causes throat swelling. The patient has a family history of hypertension, heart disease, and breast cancer. The patient does not smoke, consumes alcohol socially (two to three drinks a month), and denies illicit drug use. The patient is married and monogamous.
