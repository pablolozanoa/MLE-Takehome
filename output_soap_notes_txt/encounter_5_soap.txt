Subjective:
The patient's father, Mr. Samara, reported that his son, Ramesh, had been experiencing a sore throat and flu-like symptoms. Mr. Samara expressed concern about meningitis due to a recent public health alert at his son's school. He stated that he had informed Dr. Jones of his concerns and requested antibiotics, but was told that antibiotics were not necessary as the condition was viral. Mr. Samara followed Dr. Jones' advice to administer ibuprofen, but Ramesh's condition worsened, leading to drowsiness and vomiting. Ramesh was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where he received IV fluids and antibiotics. Mr. Samara expressed significant distress and anger over the situation, feeling that Dr. Jones did not adequately address his concerns.

Objective:
The transcript does not provide specific details of any physical examination or objective findings from the clinician during this visit. The focus was on addressing the father's concerns and the complaint process.

Assessment:
The primary concern is the father's dissatisfaction with the care provided by Dr. Jones and the subsequent hospitalization of his son, Ramesh, for suspected meningitis. The clinician acknowledged the father's distress and the need for a thorough investigation into the care provided.

Plan:
1. The clinician will speak with Dr. Smith, the senior partner, to initiate a practice meeting to review the care provided to Ramesh.
2. The practice manager will contact Mr. Samara to acknowledge the complaint and explain the complaint process within three days.
3. A root cause analysis will be conducted to identify any opportunities for improvement in the care process.
4. The practice will communicate the outcome of the investigation to Mr. Samara and provide guidance on further escalation if needed.
