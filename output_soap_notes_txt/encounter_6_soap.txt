Diagnosis: See Assessment details below.

Subjective:
The patient, Tell Harding, reports no known issues with his heart and has not been informed of any heart problems by a doctor. He mentions experiencing shortness of breath during exertion, such as running for a bus, but considers it normal. He has no history of shoulder problems and describes his shoulders as quite flexible. He has had his blood pressure measured during annual check-ups with his GP, with results typically described as "within the normal range."

Objective:
A comprehensive cardiovascular examination was performed. The examiner inspected the patient's hands, face, and neck, and assessed the pulse at various sites, including the wrists and below the collarbone. The pulse was noted to be regular. Blood pressure was measured twice, both readings within the normal range. The examiner conducted a facial examination, including inspection of the eyes and tongue. The neck was palpated, and auscultation was performed. The chest was inspected, palpated, and auscultated in multiple positions, with no abnormalities noted. The back was examined through percussion and auscultation, revealing clear lung sounds. The abdomen was palpated and auscultated, with normal findings. The feet were examined for pulses, temperature, and appearance, all normal.

Assessment:
The examination findings suggest normal cardiovascular and respiratory function. No abnormalities were detected during the physical examination. Further evaluation with an ECG, chest x-rays, and review of any existing blood work is planned to complete the cardiovascular assessment.

Plan:
1. Perform an ECG to assess the electrical activity of the heart.
2. Review any available chest x-rays for further evaluation.
3. Examine any existing blood work for additional insights.
4. Continue routine monitoring of blood pressure during annual check-ups.
