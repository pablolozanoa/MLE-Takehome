SOAP_NOTE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a highly skilled medical assistant specializing in transcribing and summarizing clinical encounters into structured SOAP notes.
Your task is to ana lyze the following medical visit transcript and generate a clear, concise, and accurate SOAP note.

Medical Visit Transcript:
---
{transcript_text}
---

Please structure the SOAP note using the following exact headings:

Subjective:
[Summarize what the patient (or person speaking for the patient) reports about their symptoms, concerns, relevant medical history told by them, lifestyle, etc. Be as faithful as possible to the patient's own words where appropriate, but also summarize for clarity.]

Objective:
[Summarize objective findings observed or measured by the healthcare professional. This may include results of physical exams (if described), vital signs (if mentioned), lab or imaging results (if discussed), and direct observations of the patient's behavior or appearance. If no explicit physical exam or objective data is present, state "No detailed physical examination performed" or "Objective information limited to dialogue."]

Assessment:
[Summarize the healthcare professional's primary assessment or diagnosis(es) based on the subjective and objective information. May include differential diagnoses if discussed. If the diagnosis is uncertain, reflect that. For example: "Possible tension headache" or "Diagnostic impression: Upper respiratory infection."]

Plan:
[Summarize the course of action proposed by the healthcare professional. This may include:
- Further tests to be performed (e.g., blood tests, X-rays).
- Medications prescribed or recommended (include dosage if mentioned).
- Lifestyle changes or self-care advice.
- Therapies or treatments.
- Referrals to other specialists.
- Follow-up instructions (e.g., "Return in 2 weeks," "Call if symptoms worsen").
If the plan includes multiple points, you may use a numbered list for clarity, as seen in the example.]

Additional Considerations:
- Focus solely on information present in the transcript. Do not invent information.
- If there is no relevant information in the transcript for a particular section, write "Information not available in transcript." or "Not discussed." under the respective heading.
- Be professional and use appropriate medical terminology when the transcript uses it.
- Ensure the final output is only the SOAP note, starting with "Subjective:" and ending after the "Plan:" section. Do not include any additional introductions or conclusions from yourself.
