Hi there. My name is Kelsey Layman. I'm a medical student working with the doctor. Is it all right if I ask you a few questions? Yeah, absolutely. All right. Well, it's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
So, what brings you in today? So, I've just been having these headaches um probably for about the past week, and I've noticed that they've just gotten a lot worse. So, I thought it better come in. Okay.
Um would you say it's kind of a sharp headache or a dull headache? Um definitely more dull. Um kind of a dull and it throbs sometimes. Okay.
Is it located on any particular part of your head? Yeah, I think I definitely feel it most like right here and it kind of sometimes feels like like really tight right here too. Okay.
Does it seem to be worse at any particular part of the day? I haven't noticed like depending on the time of day, but I I have recognized that if I have so I'm a graduate student um and I'm working on my thesis defense and I have noticed if I have like a really stressed day about that or maybe I'm setting up a lab for the students and just a stressful day at work it is worse after that. Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, thank you. That does sound stressful.
Yeah. If you um had to put it on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being the worst pain that you could imagine, where would you put it? Um probably about a five right in the middle. Okay. Yeah. Um how long does it usually last whenever you get a headache? Usually for a couple hours.
Couple hours. Yeah.
Um have you tried anything for it? Yes, I have tried exedin migraine which does help when I take it. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's good. Yeah.
Have you had any nausea or vomiting? No.
Have you noticed um like you have something that tells you that it's coming on? Like any like change in smell, vision? No, I don't think so.
Okay.
Um have you had any headaches in the morning when you first wake up? I think they tend to be more work after work.
Yeah. Um would you say that it's getting progressively worse or does it seem like it's about the same? Um it's about the same. Maybe one day is a little worse than some other days, but I don't think it it's getting worse and worse and worse.
Okay. Definitely a little bit worse than when they first started, though. Okay.
Um have you noticed any um weakness in any of your extremities?
any numbness or tingling? N Okay. Um I'd like to ask you a few questions about just kind of some of your past history just to get a better idea of what might be going on. Um can you tell me um do you drink any caffeine? Yes, I do have a cup or two of coffee about every morning to kind of help me wake up. I just can't seem to wake up without it. Okay.
Have you been skipping that at all?
Nope. Um, any alcohol? I might have a couple beers on the weekend, but nothing more than that usually. Okay.
Any tobacco use? No.
Wait, do you mean smoking or I mean it's neither for both.
Um, how is your diet? I eat pretty healthy. I try to eat a lot of vegetables, so I feel like I'm a pretty healthy eater.
Okay. Um, do you exercise at all? Yes, I exercise about three or four times a week. Um, about an hour every time.
Okay. Yeah, that sounds awesome. Any recreational drug use? No.
and you said you were a grad student and that's been pretty stressful.
Okay.
Um, let's see. Do you have any past medical history? Um, when I was younger, I did have seasonal allergies and eczema. Okay. And how are those now?
They're okay. I have to take um some like benadryil kind of um allergies because I still have those a lot, but I haven't had an eczema breakout in quite a while. Um, any drug allergies that you know of? No. No.
Okay. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
No. Any hospitalizations? Nope.
Can you tell me about your family's history? Like your mom and your dad? Um yeah, so my mom h does have hypothyroid and then my dad um he does have high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
Okay. And I do have a grandma that had died of brain cancer. Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that. Yeah. And I guess kind of the reason I came in is because that I've been a little bit more worried about ever since that happened. Do you think that this could be cancer?
Well, some of the symptoms that you're describing to me aren't really leading me to think that this is cancer. Um, however, I am glad that you came in today. Um, whenever I bring this up with the doctor, we'll be sure to address that. But as of right now, I appreciate that. Okay.
Let's see. And then you said you you take Benadryl occasionally. Any other medicines? No. Okay.
All right, I think that's about all the questions that I want to ask you. Is it all right if I do a quick physical exam?
Yeah, that sounds great. Okay, I'd like to listen to your heart first.
Is it all right if I pull your gown a little bit? Yeah, of course.
And the last one we'll listen to come around to the side. Okay.
And now we'll listen to your lungs. I'm just going to kind of scoop you down to the sky. Okay. Take a deep breath in and out through an open mouth.
And another. And last one. Good. Does everything sound okay so far? Okay. All sounds good. I'm going to check your eyes now. So, just look straight at the tip of my nose.
Good. Now, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head.
Good. All right. I want you to close your eyes. I'm going to touch both sides of your face. I want you to tell me if they feel equal and the same.
Y good. Now, I want you to try to make some funny faces. So, puff out your cheeks, raise your eyebrows, then squeeze your eyes really tight. I'm going to try to open them.
Good. All right. And now I want you to shrug your shoulders against me. Good.
And relax. Good job. All right. That all looks good. Um I would also uh like to try something called OMT, which is osteopathic manipulative therapy. Okay.
Um so I'm just going to kind of feel on your neck and see if I can loosen up some of those tissues that may be contributing to this headache. Okay.
Yeah. I think a friend of mine had a a really bad headache and she went to a DO and they said they did she said they did something like that and it made her feel better. So, you're going to possibly do that to me today? I would like to try. All right. First, I'm going to um get you a gown. Put this on and I'm going to pull out this foot stool for you. I'm lay down.
So, I'm just going to touch both sides of your neck. Let me know if any of this is uncomfortable for you. Okay.
Okay. That actually feels really good.
Good. Just going to work on loosening up those tissues because you're probably super tense. You've got a lot going on right now.
Um, and so kind of what some of your symptoms are telling me is this is probably a tension headache. Okay. Um, probably just because you've got a lot of stress going on in your life. Okay.
Yeah. So, what I want to do, um, I'll go talk with the doctor for sure and we'll be back in, um, talk to you more, but I want you to continue that eed migraine.
And then we'll also probably give you some self stretches to do at home. Oh, okay. So, you think my neck is contributing to this? I think so, probably. Okay. Or at least it in some way. Okay. So, hopefully some of this will help.
I want you to just relax. Let your head fall back into my hands.
Okay, I want you to try to return your head back to it normal position.
Good. And relax. I want you to do that again.
four and relax. And last time, two and relax. Okay, that feels better to me.
Does that feel better to you? Yeah, it feels a lot looser. Okay, good.
All right, I'm going to help you up.
Yeah, it does feel a lot better. Good.
Um, do you have any uh other questions for me? No, I think you answered it. I I think I was really worried about the grandma, my grandma's, um, history of brain cancer, but I I feel a lot better now. Okay. Well, I'm going to go talk with the doctor. Um, we'll probably come back in and talk to you a little bit more, see if he has anything to say. We may do a fundoscopic exam, which is where we look at the back of your eye when we come back in. Is it all right if I come back in with them? Yes, absolutely. All right. Well, it's very nice to meet you. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, too.

It's gotten a lot worse. Um, can you kind of describe the pain to me? What it feels like? Well, it was kind of like a icky, achy kind of feeling. And now it's really sharp. Like it feels like someone's stabbing me. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. That sounds awful. Okay. Well, hopefully we'll get this figured out and get you feeling better. Um, so while we're talking about your pain, if you could rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being no pain, 10 being you would pass out. The pain is so bad, what do you think you're at right now? Probably a seven. Okay. Okay. Um, so is there anything that you've noticed that makes the pain worse?

Um I what you're describing today seems a little bit as if your appendix might actually be infected. Um, so what we normally do for that is contact a surgeon, which I'm going to go leave the room and talk with the physician and we'll probably be referring a surgeon and then um they will talk to you about getting that removed. They might want to put you on some antibiotics. Um, what I'm going to do in the meantime is probably get a CT scan. And I know this is a lot of information at once. Um, just to we want to make sure that just infected and it's not actually ruptured open. Um, and then I'll actually probably just get a couple simple blood tests just to make sure just to check a few things. How does that sound to you?
