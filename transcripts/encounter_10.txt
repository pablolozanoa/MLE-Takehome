[Interviewer]: Alright, so let’s, uh, go through some standard memory tests... and what I want you to do is, uh, try to remember a few things, and I’ll... I’ll ask you again in a couple of minutes, okay?

First off—three words: Chevrolet... zebra... honesty.
Can you repeat those?
[Subject]: Uh... Chevrolet, zebra, honesty.

[Interviewer]: Okay, now... just, um, three things here in the room—uh, that TV monitor next to you, the, um... the computer, my stopwatch... and—uh, this book.
So, what were those three things?
[Subject]: TV... the, um... stopwatch, and the book.

[Interviewer]: Great. Alright, so try to remember the, uh, the words and the items, and I’ll check back in just a bit.

Now... what day of the week is it?
[Subject]: Today’s Saturday.
[Interviewer]: Mm-hmm.

And what city are we in?
[Subject]: Boston.
[Interviewer]: Yep.

And... the date?
[Subject]: Uh... October 21st?
[Interviewer]: No, actually, uh—it’s November 21st.
[Subject]: Oh, right... yeah, sorry. I—I don’t really keep track of dates anymore.
[Interviewer]: That’s alright. Happens a lot.

What year is it?
[Subject]: Uh, 1998.
[Interviewer]: Okay.

Who’s the President right now?
[Subject]: Clinton.

And before him?
[Subject]: Uh... Reagan—I mean, Bush. Sorry.
[Interviewer]: That’s okay, really common.

Before Bush?
[Subject]: Reagan.
[Interviewer]: And then before that?
[Subject]: Carter.

Okay... now, any—uh, current events? What’s going on in the world right now?
[Subject]: Hmm... good question. I, uh... I played golf the last couple of days. Haven’t watched much. But, um... the presidential hearings—that’s happening.
[Interviewer]: Yep, and do you know what that’s about?
[Subject]: The, uh... Monica Lewinsky thing. Impeachment hearings.
[Interviewer]: That’s right.

Alright. Can you spell world... backwards?
[Subject]: Uh... D-L-R-O-W.

[Interviewer]: Great. Can you show me how you’d use a comb to—uh, comb your hair?
[Subject]: [mimes combing]

And how would you blow out a candle?
[Subject]: [blows out softly]

Okay... now take this page, draw the face of a clock—make the circle, put in the numbers, and set the hands to... um, ten past eleven.
[Subject]: Ten past eleven? Haven’t done this in a while.
[Interviewer]: Yep. That’s right.

Now say this after me: No ifs, ands or buts.
[Subject]: No ifs, ands or buts.

Alright. Now, the three things we pointed to in the room—do you remember those?
[Subject]: TV... watch... and book.

And those three words?
[Subject]: Chevrolet... zebra... honesty.

Okay. Take this again—uh, anywhere on here, just write a simple sentence, anything that comes to mind.
[Subject]: [writes]

Okay... that’s meant to be, like, a 3D drawing. Can you try drawing a cube?
[Subject]: [draws]

Now let’s say this whole page is a map of the U.S.—go ahead and put a "C" for California, an "F" for Florida... where’s your hometown? Just initials. And, uh, where would Denver be? And the Gulf of Mexico?
[Subject]: [marks locations]

[Interviewer]: Okay. So for mental status, that’s pretty much all I’d cover for a screening like this. You’ve shown orientation to geography, memory—both verbal and visual—recall of past and current events, language... only things we’d go deeper into would be, uh, focus, attention span, maybe some math, but not right now.

Based on what I’ve seen from you today—and just, y’know, seeing how you operate—I’d say there’s nothing to worry about at this point.
[Subject]: Okay.

[Interviewer]: Yep. Everything seems to be working just fine.
