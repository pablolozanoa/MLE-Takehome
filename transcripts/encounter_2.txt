hello there Miss Jones hi there my name is Kelsey I'm a medical student working with your physician is it okay if I ask you a few questions and do a brief physical exam nice to meet you all right so what brings you in today thanks okay when do they start for you about two to three weeks ago two to three weeks ago okay and how often are they occurring I would say at least three times a week three times okay and are they pretty constant throughout the day or seem to be worse at a particular point I think I'm noticing more in the evenings evenings okay was there anything that began two weeks ago that you think these might be associated with okay can you kind of describe how the headaches feel okay and are they located on any particular part of your head just like right here okay so just kind of around the front of your head and maybe on the temples okay and if you had to put it on a scale from one to ten or zero to ten zero being no pain ten being the worst pain you can imagine where would this fall about five okay so that sounds like it's interfering with your life quite a bit yeah it is okay does anything seem to make it worse I think I've noticed that so I'm a graduate student and if I'm setting up a lab for students or working on my thesis anything that kind of stresses me out I think that that seems to make it worse okay so stress seems to be the main factor yeah does anything seem to make it better if I think it an exaggerated migraine it gets better excedrin okay and then have you noticed any other kinds of symptoms with this really no have you been having any nausea or vomiting no any sort of flashes of white or floaters no okay and you said they occur more so in the evening you don't wake up with a headache okay do you feel like they're getting progressively worse I do think in the last week or so they've gotten worse okay have you noticed any sort of numbness or tingling in your hands or feet any weakness any fevers or chills no and then I'm also going to ask you a few questions just kind of about your general health can you tell me about your diet yeah I eat pretty healthy okay lots of fruits and vegetables lean protein good very good not allergic to any foods no okay do you exercise at all yeah I do hot yoga okay and then any recreational drugs any tobacco use any alcohol do you drink any caffeine coffee everyday okay and have you change your routine with that at all no no haven't been skipping any mornings okay I just want to make sure that's not a caffeine headache that would be a simple fix and you said you're a graduate student right now no part-time job and then what's your relationship status I am married married okay for how long three years all right and then do you have any medical issues that you're currently being treated for I have an inhaler I have asthma I haven't used it probably six months though okay any medical conditions in your past no okay healthy growing up yep very good any drug allergies that you know of sofa sofa okay any past surgeries know any hospitalizations okay and then can you tell me about your family's health how's your mom how's your dad yeah both my parents are pretty healthy my dad has high blood pressure my mom doesn't take medicine for anything okay any history of any cancers in the family not well wait my grandpa had lung cancer but he smoked nothing and then are you taking any other medications besides the excedrin all right well I think I've got a pretty good history here I'm gonna transition over to the physical exam okay I'm just gonna listen to your heart first I'm going to pull your gown down a little bit okay go listen to your lungs big breath in and out through an open mouth one more last one let's see all right I'm just gonna take a look in your eyes very good can you open your mouth any sort of pain when I push here no really okay all right I want you to follow my finger so move just your eyes not your head okay good now I'm just gonna touch your face does this feel equal on both sides okay all right now I'm gonna have you make some funny faces for me once you lift your eyebrows up real high now I'll squeeze your eyes shut don't let me pull them open good puff out your cheeks I'm gonna press them okay good now stick out your tongue all right good now try to push my hand away good and the other side good shrug your shoulders they're good all right now I'm just gonna check some reflexes so just let your hand rest on your flex very good and cross your life thank you good okay hold your arms up like this don't let me push you down don't let me push you up don't me push it in don't let me push you out very good I'm gonna do the same thing so try and push up push up and down down push out pull in fish up and push down very good okay and then also does this feel the same mm-hmm okay that feel the same yeah mmm all right I'm also going to come back in the room with the doctor here a little bit and we're gonna look in the back of your eye with one of the lights let's see all right so this sounds just kind of like a general stress headache so you may just have some tight muscles which I can actually do something for if you would like me to okay so this is called osteopathic manipulative medicine and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to try and loosen up some of those muscles okay so first I'm gonna have you lay back down oh yeah and your muscles are a little tight so I'm just doing some just gentle just kind of soft tissue kind of almost massage like so whenever you're giving me your history you weren't really telling me anything that sounds like this might be more than just a general headache I will go and present this to the physician and we'll kind of talk about it but from the sound of it if the excedrin migraine helps you then continue that okay also some heat might be really helpful to kind of relax these muscles okay yeah and I just want you to focus on letting your head just fall back into my hands very good okay now I want you to try to turn your head back to normal straight forward good and hold that for one two three and relax and again one two three and relax and last time one two three and relax very good that feels a little bit better to me yeah that's I can tell the difference - it feels better good okay all right well I'm gonna help you back up okay and I'm gonna go talk with the physician is okay if I come back in with them all right very good any other questions or concerns before I leave I don't think so no all right well it's very nice to meet you
