Dr. Back: Hello there. How are you feeling today?

Student: (A little hesitant) Yes, hello Dr. Back. I'm… well, I was fine until this morning, thank you for asking.

Dr. Back: You're welcome. So, what seems to be going on today?

Student: Well, I woke up this morning with this really strange pain on my right side, right here. (The student gestures to their lower right rib cage.) It's like, even just taking a deep breath or trying to move makes it hurt. It really hurts.

Dr. Back: Okay, I understand. It sounds concerning enough that you decided to come in.

Student: Yes, I figured it was better to get it checked out, especially since it's important.

Dr. Back: Absolutely. You mentioned it only started this morning? You woke up with it?

Student: Yes, exactly. I went to bed last night feeling completely fine, and then I woke up with this pain.

Dr. Back: And have you ever experienced anything like this before?

Student: No, this is the first time.

Dr. Back: Okay. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly the pain is? Is it more around the breast area, or is it specifically in your side?

Student: It's definitely more on my side, right in this area. (The student points again to the lower right rib cage.)

Dr. Back: And how would you describe the pain itself? What does it feel like?

Student: Uh, well, it's pretty constant. It's like a dull ache, I'd say probably somewhere between a four and a six on a pain scale of ten. But if I try to take a really deep breath, or if I twist or move suddenly, it really shoots up, like to a nine, you know, just for a minute.

Dr. Back: Okay, that's helpful to know. Is there anything that you've noticed that makes the pain worse, or anything that seems to make it a little bit better, even if just temporarily?

Student: Well, it seems like if I can find a certain position in bed and just stay still, and definitely if I don't take deep breaths, it's manageable. But trying to take a deep breath or move around… that's when it really gets bad.

Dr. Back: So, no particular position, like lying down versus sitting up, makes a significant difference in the constant level of pain?

Student: Not really. It kind of hurts all the time, just the intensity changes with movement and breathing.

Dr. Back: Have you noticed any other symptoms recently? Any nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or any unusual weight gain?

Student: No, nothing like that. But… this might be unrelated, but about two weeks ago, actually, no, it was just last week, I was jogging and I tripped over a branch. I fell on my left side, but it didn't really hurt at the time, or anything. I don't know if that's relevant at all.

Dr. Back: Hmm, it's good to mention it. And you didn't have any immediate pain associated with that fall?

Student: No, not really. Maybe a little bit of a bruise later, but nothing significant.

Dr. Back: Okay. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Do you have any history of illnesses like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, thyroid problems? Generally, would you say you've been pretty healthy?

Student: Yes, I'd say I'm generally pretty healthy. No history of any of those conditions.

Dr. Back: Do you have any allergies that you're aware of?

Student: Uh, yeah, I'm allergic to morphine.

Dr. Back: Morphine. And what happens when you have morphine?

Student: My throat swells up, it's not good.

Dr. Back: Okay, good to know. When was the last time you had a reaction to morphine?

Student: It was years ago, when I had my wisdom teeth out.

Dr. Back: Okay. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?

Student: No, nothing regularly.

Dr. Back: Any surgical history, besides the wisdom teeth removal?

Student: No, that was it, about ten years ago.

Dr. Back: Okay. And what about your family history? As far as your parents, were they generally healthy?

Student: Well, my dad died when he was 65. He had hypertension and heart disease, and he died of a heart attack. My mother died when she was 60, and she had breast cancer.

Dr. Back: I'm sorry to hear that. And just to get a better picture of your lifestyle, what do you do for work?

Student: I write children's books.

Dr. Back: Oh, really? Do you illustrate them as well, or just write?

Student: Just write them. Someone else does the illustrations.

Dr. Back: That's fascinating. And what about tobacco use? Do you smoke?

Student: No, I don't smoke.

Dr. Back: How about alcohol?

Student: Maybe two or three drinks a month, you know, socially.

Dr. Back: Okay. And any illicit drug use?

Student: No, definitely not.

Dr. Back: And your sexual history? Are you married?

Student: Yes, I am.

Dr. Back: And do you have regular sexual activity? Are you monogamous with your wife?

Student: Yes, we are.

Dr. Back: Okay. So, as we've talked, do you have any other questions for me at this point, or any ideas about what might be going on?

Student: Nothing really. I mean, when it first started, I thought maybe I just slept on it wrong or something, and I figured it would go away in an hour or two, you know? I just didn't want to ignore it if it was something more serious. Better safe than sorry, right?

Dr. Back: Absolutely. You did the right thing coming in. Based on what you've told me, we need to do a physical examination to get a better sense of what might be causing this pain. We might also need to consider some imaging tests depending on what we find during the exam. How does that sound?

Student: That sounds good, Dr. Back. Thank you.
