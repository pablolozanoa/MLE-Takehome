hello hi hi there doc have a seat yeah
hi
um so i we we just talked on the phone
didn't we my name's doctor weber's right
yes
i know you've previously been seeing my
colleague having me
yes yes i saw that dr
um
donovan yeah um and
he
did that scan for gallstones
yeah okay um so so what happened from
there then did just tell me a little bit
about what's happened so that i'm up to
speed uh well i went for that scan and
then i was a bit surprised actually they
actually uh rang me up
um and it's a few days afterwards and
said that i needed another scan to check
things out okay so i was there
it was on monday this week when i went
and they've gone through that doughnutty
thing
um
and then and then you give me a ring
okay so in between the scan happening
and the second scan happening was it the
department that had wronged you or
already spoken to doctor
about it no no it was it was a nice
sound girl who rang me saying they were
booking this this disappointments
for this extra scam and did they give
you any idea why they needed to do an
extra one no they didn't actually i mean
i i tried to ask you always do and
that's sweet talk with lady but yeah she
was not fatally okay and i do have any
thoughts yourself or any worries about
why they were calling me back i guessed
it was must be a goal sense
so just tell me a little bit about what
symptoms you've been having then but um
we do have um your skin result here
today and i'll there is something we
need to discuss on it right i'd just
like to make sure that i know what's
been happening to you first of all and
then we'll go into the detail it all
started a few months ago really with his
tummy pain yeah and then i said i saw
your colleague and he said we'd better
get a scan yeah so i went for that scan
it was only what two weeks ago
and then i got literally four or five
days later got the
phone call i needed this additional scan
so i went on monday and had that done
okay
okay and so do you still have pain at
the minute yes yeah i mean it's just
there all the time okay
um well as i said your scan result has
come through to me today yes and i'm
afraid there is something that's
potentially a little bit worrying on it
really
yeah
i didn't explain that
so what's what's the worrying thing that
you found
well
if i take you back to the first scan
first of all so um
what it appears that that showed is that
there was something um suspicious
um on what we call new pancreas gland
suspicious yeah
so there is a gland at sort of the top
of your abdomen here which is quite
close to your gallbladder right
and called your pancreas and when they
did the ultrasound scan which is a good
scan but isn't particularly detailed
right there was something on it that
they saw that they wanted a little bit
more information about
right so that's why they called it back
for the second scan doesn't sound good
does it
well that was a ct scan which is a
detailed one so that we could see what
it is that we're likely to be talking
about right
so the second scan has shown that there
definitely is something
on your pancreas gland
really
and when i say something
what we need to worry about is whether
or not this could be a type of cancer
god
i didn't expect that
god i'm only 47.
cancer and i'm really sorry to have to
break it to you like this but i felt
that it was important that as soon as i
knew
that i communicated that to you and that
you knew what you were thinking as well
god
so
i mean i know that i've just dropped a a
big bombshell on you oh yeah yes god
have you got any any questions at the
minute have you got anything that you
that's um
what's the pancreas and if i have got
cancer um
what can you know can they can they cut
it out
um
it depends um
basically your pancreas is a gland that
sort of sits at the top of the abdomen
as i said and it controls some of the
sort of the the hormones the the fluids
that your body your body makes
um
because it's at the back of the abdomen
often we don't
know very much about it until it starts
causing a bit of a problem like your
pain you've been getting
so that probably explains why you've not
had many other
symptoms right right
um
the answer is i don't know what could be
done about it but we need to ask a
specialist okay what could be done about
it okay um
what what we usually do in this
situation is ask a specialist to see
your scan and i'll let them know today
okay so have a
right do they agree that it could be
potentially cancer and how do we find
out what it definitely is okay
and then from that
what we do about it okay
okay
so i understand that i've just thrown a
whole lot of information at you and a
lot of it is very worrying information
oh yeah god i i just hadn't expected
that
yeah
and
i mean
is there is there anybody that you could
that you could bring in with you and
what could i win a little bit of a chat
maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit
bit more
my mum time you know
by myself
no i'll come by myself actually you sure
yeah okay it'll just be easier
she'll just
yeah
yeah
i mean i think it's important to say
that we don't know for definite what
this is
we have to
imagine that it is something
like a cancer until we can prove what it
is right and so we do everything very
quickly yeah try and get some answers
for you right um but we don't know any
definitely certain at the minute
um
but i do appreciate that i have just
given you okay some scary news yeah um
take a little bit of time
um so my door is open and i wonder if
maybe we
have another appointment tomorrow i'll
just have a bit of a chat
um
yes yeah okay have you got any questions
at the minute
uh no no
okay
um
i have i've taken the liberty of
printing off a little bit of something
about pancreatic cancer if that's what
this is
um for you to have a bit of a read
through okay some of it's a little bit a
little bit scary and as i said we don't
know there's nothing certain yet
but i wonder if you might want to have a
bit of a read through of it
before coming back to see me
so what this does is it just explains a
little bit about what the pancreas is
right into more detail than i've been
able to today
and
it talks about cancer in general
the types of ways in which it can affect
the pancreas okay and what sort of
symptoms you can get okay
and then how you
download it and how we work out what we
do about it okay so it talks about the
different types of scans that you've had
and this one this ct scan yes the one
that you've had okay
and
then depending on
what they find yeah
it
gives you a brief run through the
different types of treatment
okay okay
would you want to have a read through
this and then maybe come back and see me
tomorrow yeah i'll be back tomorrow yeah
okay thanks
i i i'm sorry to have to break this news
to you like this but i felt that as soon
as i knew it i needed to make sure that
you knew it as well
while we try and work out what's going
on as quickly as i can
okay
i'll see you tomorrow okay
