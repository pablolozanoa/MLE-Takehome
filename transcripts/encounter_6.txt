Examiner: Hello, I'm going to perform a cardiovascular examination on you today. This will involve looking at your hands, examining your face, asking you to take your shirt off, and then checking your chest. Would that be alright with you?
Patient: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Thank you for explaining what you'll be doing.
Examiner: Before we start, could you please confirm your name and date of birth for me?
Patient: My name is Tell Harding, that's T-E-L-L H-A-R-D-I-N-G, and my date of birth is [Date of Birth].
Examiner: Thank you, Mr. Harding. And are you aware of any problems with your heart at all? Anything you've been told by a doctor in the past, or any symptoms you've noticed yourself?
Patient: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any issues with my heart that I'm aware of. I mean, sometimes I get a bit out of breath when I really exert myself, like running for the bus, but I think that's just normal, isn't it? Nothing specific to my heart, I don't believe.
Examiner: Okay, thank you for that information. To start, could you please put your hands out in front of you for me? I'm just going to have a good look here at your palms and fingers. Now, if you could turn your hands over, so I can see the backs of them. And if you would bring your fingernails together like so, just the tips touching. That's brilliant. Okay, we're going to take your pulse now. I'll do this on both hands, just to get a good reading. That feels nice and regular. And if you could just relax your arms down by your sides for a moment, we're going to take your pulse here on your wrist as well. Okay, that feels good too. Now, you mentioned you haven't had any shoulder problems, is that correct? Because we need to assess the pulse in another way, and that involves feeling just below your collarbone.
Patient: Yes, that's right, no problems with my shoulders at all. They're quite flexible, actually.
Examiner: Okay, good. So, I'm just going to take your wrist like so, and then lift it up slightly. One, two, three. That's fine. Just here, it feels the same again as in your other wrist. Good, no problems there. Now, what I'd like to do next is take your blood pressure, if that's alright with you? Have you had your blood pressure measured before?
Patient: Yes, I have. Usually at my annual check-up with my GP.
Examiner: Okay, and were there any problems or anything unusual noted with your blood pressure on those occasions?
Patient: Not that I recall, no. They usually say it's "within the normal range," whatever that means!
Examiner: Okay, well we're going to do this twice today, if that's okay. Once with the stethoscope that you're probably familiar with, and once without, just using my sense of touch. If you have any problems with the cuff feeling too tight or anything like that, please just let me know, and try to relax your arm for me, please. Excellent. So, we'll just do the same again on your other arm. That's good. Okay, both of those readings are within the normal range, so that's good to know.
Examiner: Now, I'm going to have a look at your face, if I may. So, if you could take your glasses off for me, please. Okay, and if you could lean back slightly on the pillow there. That's it. Now, if you could look up towards the ceiling for me. That's great. And if you could show me your tongue, please? Stick it right out. And now, if you could put the tip of your tongue up to the roof of your mouth. Perfect. Now, I'd like to have a look at your neck. So, I'm just going to gently place my hands on either side of your neck. If you could just relax back for me. Okay, I'll do the same again on the opposite side. Now, I'm going to have a listen with my stethoscope here, if you don't mind. We'll both breathe together. So, take a deep breath in for me, hold it for a moment, and then breathe normally. We'll do the same again. Deep breath in, and hold it. Excellent.
Examiner: Now, if I could get you to take your shirt off, please? Thank you. And again, if you could just lie back a little bit further on the pillow. I'm just going to start off by having a look around the base of your neck, just observing. I can't see any obvious problems there. Now, if you could turn your head all the way over to your right, and then all the way over to your left for me. That's helpful, thank you. Now, I'm going to gently push on your tummy in a few different places. Do you have any pain or tenderness here? Okay, one, two, three. That feels fine. Now, we're going to move on to actually looking at your heart more directly now. So, I'm just going to place my hand on your chest, so I can feel the beat. And if you could roll onto your left side for me, please. That's fine. Now, if you could lie back for me again. We're going to go on to actually listen to your heart now with my stethoscope. So, I'm just going to place it on different areas of your chest. I might press a little bit firmly, but it shouldn't be painful. Please tell me at any time if there's any discomfort. Now, we're just going to have a quick listen to your heart. If you could please continue to breathe normally for me. And if you would once again roll onto your left side, please. That's fine. Now, if you could sit up for me, please. And I'm going to put my stethoscope on your chest again, and we're going to breathe together again. So, take a deep breath in, breathe out, and hold it. Fantastic.
Examiner: Whilst you're sitting up, we're going to have a look at your back now. So, if you could cross your arms over your chest for me, please. That's it. And I'm going to gently tap down your back in a few places. And we'll do the same again, but this time I'll be listening with my stethoscope. So, if you could breathe in and out through your mouth for me, please. And out. And in. And out. And in. And out. And in. And out. Super. So, there don't appear to be any problems there with your lungs. Just to finish off on your back, I'm going to push in gently at the base of your spine. Good, no problem there. So, if you could remain sitting there for just a second. We now need to lie the bed flat again, and I'm going to have another feel of your abdomen. Okay, so if you would lie back down, please. Once again, if you feel any discomfort at all when I'm pressing, please just tell me at the time. Perfect. So, I need to push in gently with both hands in different areas. That all feels normal to the touch. Now, we have to listen over your abdomen as well with the stethoscope. So, I'm just going to place it here and there. I can't hear anything abnormal, which is good. Now, I'm going to finish off the examination by looking at your feet and checking the pulses there. Okay, both of those pulses feel normal. I'm just checking the temperature and appearance of your feet here at the end. Okay, so that all appears to be normal.
Examiner: There's your t-shirt. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Harding?
Patient: Um, no, I don't think so. Everything seems pretty straightforward. When you were listening to my heart and back, were you listening for anything in particular? Just out of curiosity.
Examiner: Yes, I was listening for the normal heart sounds, the rhythm, and any extra sounds that might indicate something else. And on your back, I was listening to the air moving in and out of your lungs to make sure that sounded clear and equal on both sides.
Patient: Oh, I see. That makes sense. Thank you for explaining that. So, everything seems okay so far then?
Examiner: Yes, based on this part of the examination, everything appears to be normal. As I mentioned at the beginning, we'll complete the cardiovascular examination by having a look at an ECG, which is a recording of the electrical activity of your heart, and checking any chest x-rays that might have been done previously, as well as reviewing any blood work that's already been taken.
Patient: Right, I understand. So, this is just one part of the whole picture. Thank you for taking the time to do this today.
Examiner: You're very welcome, Mr. Harding. Thank you for your cooperation.
