DR. GILL: My name's Dr. Gill. I've been asked to do an examination of your cranial nerves, so the nerves that control your face and head.

PATIENT: Okay.

DR. GILL: To start off, could you confirm to me your name and date of birth please?

PATIENT: [Patient confirms information]

DR. GILL: Perfect. So to start off, we'll look at your sense of smell. Have you noticed any changes with your nose at all?

PATIENT: No.

DR. GILL: Okay, so no blocked nose and eyes. If you could put a finger over one nostril and breathe in and relax, and we'll do the same again on the opposite side.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Super. I've got a substance here. If you close your eyes and tell me what you can smell, if anything.

PATIENT: Coffee.

DR. GILL: Super. Okay, that confirms everything's working there. Thank you. So now we need to actually see how well your vision is. Do you wear glasses normally?

PATIENT: Yes.

DR. GILL: Okay. Do you have them with you?

PATIENT: [Indicates yes]

DR. GILL: And if you had any changes to prescription recently?

PATIENT: [Indicates no]

DR. GILL: Okay. So if you look at my face, is my face all clear? No black splotches? I'm not missing an eye?

PATIENT: Perfect.

DR. GILL: So what I'd like to do to start off with, behind me is a Snellen chart. Could you cover your right eye for me?

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay, and what's the lowest line you can read on there? Could you start from the left please?

PATIENT: [Reads chart]

DR. GILL: Perfect. Just swap eyes. If you put your hand over your left eye, what's the lowest line you could read? And start from the right side of the paper.

PATIENT: [Reads chart]

DR. GILL: Perfect. So you've got no problems there. Now I'm going to shine a light in your eyes. So if you put a hand over your left eye forward please, and then over the right eye.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay, and relax back to normal. That's fine, thank you. So there, no problems at all with that. Just walk over, the same thing, that's fine. The next thing, if you'd look at my finger, and now at that ceiling behind me, now at the finger.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Superb. Now in order to really get a good idea of how your eyes are working, I actually need to have a look at the back. Would that be okay?

PATIENT: Yeah.

DR. GILL: So I'm going to shine the light directly in your eye, but I'm going to have to come quite close to do that.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay, so if you just keep looking straight ahead for me. Okay, if you could look up please. And if you look down. Good. Left. And look to the right. Not directly into the light. Okay, thank you. I will just do a view of the other side. Are you okay?

PATIENT: [Indicates yes]

DR. GILL: Okay. Going to do the same again. Look up for me. And down. And left. And right. I'm not great with the light, please.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay, so now we're going to see how well your eyes work on the very side. So we're going to look at your peripheral vision. I'm just going to make sure I'm at the right distance away. So you can see my finger waggling?

PATIENT: Yep.

DR. GILL: Tell when you can see my finger waggle.

PATIENT: Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

DR. GILL: So if it's all eyes for me. And you can see my finger waggle?

PATIENT: Yep.

DR. GILL: Please stay looking in this eye and tell when you see my finger.

PATIENT: Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

DR. GILL: Okay, so right now I need to look at how your eyes will move. So if you keep your head still for me, and I want you to follow my finger. Tell me if there's any point any problems with that.

PATIENT: [Follows with eyes]

DR. GILL: Excellent. So to finish off now, I'm going to have you put, which is your preferred hand, over one eye for me. Okay, and I'm going to show you a pen top. Can you tell me what color that is?

PATIENT: Red.

DR. GILL: Okay. And if you could swap hands and this?

PATIENT: [Responds]

DR. GILL: Okay. Are they the same red on both sides?

PATIENT: [Indicates yes]

DR. GILL: Okay, so it doesn't seem to become paler in one eye compared to the other. You see that? Now we're going to have a look for something called your blind spot. So if you can put a hand over one eye for me. Okay, and I want you to only look into this eye here, and at some point as I move the pen across, the pen will disappear, or the pen top will.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay, so tell me if it's gone now. I'm gonna carry on moving it across and tell when it reappears.

PATIENT: Okay, it's gone.

DR. GILL: Okay, and tell when it reappears.

PATIENT: Here.

DR. GILL: Okay, I'm gonna go up there. And then down. Done?

PATIENT: [Indicates done]

DR. GILL: Super. Okay, and that's when coming back.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Excellent. So we swap over to the other eye. Right eye. Again, looking at my eye here, tell me when it disappears.

PATIENT: Done.

DR. GILL: Okay, tell when it reappears.

PATIENT: [Indicates when it reappears]

DR. GILL: I just want it displayed. Okay, fine, I'm now going up.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Excellent. So your blind spot lines up well with mine there. Thank you. I appreciate that's a slightly difficult test to do. And now we're going to look at your sense of sensation on your face. So I've got a little point here, but it is blunt, and if I could have a finger.

PATIENT: [Offers finger]

DR. GILL: Okay, so you can see you can feel it, but it isn't sharp. If you close your eyes and tell me when you feel it.

PATIENT: Yep. Yep. Yep.

DR. GILL: Okay, that's terrific. And now we're going to see what the sensation on your eyes is like again. So I've got a bit of cotton wool, and if you could look all the way to the outside for me, and I'm just going to bring this in from the side. I'm just gonna touch the side of your eye.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: That's fine. We'll do the same if you look over that way. You'll see me come in from the side.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay, super. Thank you very much. Now I'd like to tap on your forehead. Just relax on me.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay, so we've got a nice blink there. That's good. And finally, if you could try and relax your jaw for me, I'm just gonna tap over your jaw.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Okay. Now we're gonna have a quick look at the muscles that control your face. So if you could raise your eyebrows up as high as you can please.

PATIENT: [Raises eyebrows]

DR. GILL: Super. And screw your eyes tight. Don't let me open.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: That's good. Show me your teeth.

PATIENT: [Shows teeth]

DR. GILL: Okay. And blow your cheeks out for me.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: Super. Now we're gonna have a look over your hearing. Have you noticed any problems with your hearing?

PATIENT: No.

DR. GILL: Good. So we're going to start off. If you could cover the front of your ear please, and I'm going to say a word and I'd like you to repeat it. "Better" please.

PATIENT: Better.

DR. GILL: 100. Okay, if we could cover the other ear for me.

PATIENT: 99.

DR. GILL: Excellent. So we know that everything seems to be working well. Next thing we're going to do, I'm going to get this tuning fork. I'm going to strike it and I'll put it on your forehead. Okay, now we're just going to do the same again. So I'm just going to put this on your forehead and tell me if you can hear where the noise is - is it left, right, or middle?

PATIENT: [Responds]

DR. GILL: Okay, super. So we need to do an additional test on that, which will involve putting this on the bone behind your ear. When the sound stops, please tell me, and I'm going to move it round, and I want to see if you can hear it then. I'm gonna need to come around the back and do that. And tell me when you can't hear the noise anymore.

PATIENT: [Waits then responds]

DR. GILL: Okay. And can you hear it now?

PATIENT: Yeah.

DR. GILL: Excellent. Did the same on the side. Okay, you can hear the noise?

PATIENT: [Indicates yes]

DR. GILL: Okay, tell when you can't. You hear that?

PATIENT: Yeah.

DR. GILL: Excellent. Now we need to have a look in your mouth. Would you like to take a sip of water?

PATIENT: [Takes water]

DR. GILL: And swallow please. Any problems? Do you have any problems with eating or drinking?

PATIENT: No.

DR. GILL: Okay, so no coughing afterwards actually. So what we'd like to do now is, I'm just going to have a look in the back of your mouth. If you could open wide please, and nice long "Ah" please.

PATIENT: Ahhh.

DR. GILL: Super. Okay, so I'm just going to test the powers now of the muscles in your head and neck. So I need to put my hands on the side of your face, and if you could push.

PATIENT: [Pushes]

DR. GILL: Super. And we'll do the same on the other side. Push, push.

PATIENT: [Pushes]

DR. GILL: Excellent. Now I'm gonna put my arms on your shoulders. Push up for me.

PATIENT: [Pushes up]

DR. GILL: Okay, that's excellent. Now the final bit. Could you stick your tongue out for me please?

PATIENT: [Sticks tongue out]

DR. GILL: Okay, and there's no problems there. Put the tongue to the side of your mouth.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: After push back. And then the other side please.

PATIENT: [Complies]

DR. GILL: We've been having a reasonable conversation throughout, but if you could just finish off by saying A, E, I, O, and U please.

PATIENT: A, E, I, O, U.

DR. GILL: Excellent. So I've had no problems with your cranial nerves, so I can give you a clean bill of health on that. Do you have any questions for me?

PATIENT: No.

DR. GILL: Super. Thank you for your time.
